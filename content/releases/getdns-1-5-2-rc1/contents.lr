title: First release candidate for getdns-1.5.2
---
announcement:

Dear all,

We have a first candidate for the upcoming 1.5.2 GnuTLS, bugfix and maintenance release of getdns.


This release has experimental support for GnuTLS >= 3.5.0 as replacement for OpenSSL.
To enabled, use the `--with-gnutls` option at `configure` time.
Note that getdns needs the gnutls-dane library too (which is used for SPKI authentication of DNS-over-TLS upstreams).
DNSSEC validation will use the cryptographic functions from `libnettle` (the cryptographic library also used by GnuTLS).

When build with GnuTLS, getdns will still be linked with `libcrypto` (from OpenSSL) for S/MIME verification of the `root-anchors.xml` file with Zero configuration DNSSEC.
It is our intention to replace that with something more GnuTLS native at some point in the future too, so that getdns can do without OpenSSL altogether.


Maintenance work included bringing TCP Fast Open up to par with current practice.
This means that at least on Linux 4.11+, getdns can connect TFO with TLS.

The most prominent bugfix is for DNSSEC scheduling which in some circumstances wrongly failed with insecure delegations of more than one label.

A few more issues are resolved with this release.
For a complete overview see the ChangeLog below.


This release has a release candidate for [Stubby] 0.2.6 included, with updates to documentation and fixes for the Windows build.


Please review these release candidates carefully, if all is well, the actual release will follow Friday the 22th of March.
