title: getdns-1.7.1 release
---
announcement:

Dear all,

We have a new 1.7.1 release of getdns.
This is mostly a bugfix release with most prominently a fix for a crash that occured when looking up and DNSSEC validating certain RR types.

This release has a [Stubby] version 0.4.1 included with updated upstreams servers in the example [`stubby.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getdnsapi/stubby/release/0.4.1/stubby.yml.example) config file.

**NOTE!** The `dnsovertls*.sinodun.com` servers will retire later this month so we strongly encourage you to update the config file with the new default upstream servers and choose (uncomment) some additional servers from the list available.
The getdnsapi.net server is the only default resolver left and is a single point of failure in your setup if no other resolvers are chosen.

stubbychangelog:

* 2022-08-19: Version 0.4.1
  * Several updates to the servers in the config file:
     * sinodun.dnsovertls*.com servers are removed and will be
       decommissioned in the near future. This leaves only the
       getdnsapi.net server as the default.
       A recommendation is made that users choose additional servers
       from the list available.
     * Additional Quad9 servers added (thanks pataquets).
     * LDN servers removed as the service is now stopped. 
     * Tidy up of remaining server data.
     * Change `comment` lines on Uncensored server data to more clearly
       be comments (not valid YAML)
     * Fix and improve descriptions of default values
     * getdnsapi.net DoT servers liston on port 443 now too
  * Fixes for parsing of quoted key values for `tls-ca-file`,
    `tls-curves-list` and `resolvconf`
  * Add Dockerfile into `contrib` - thanks to pataquets.
  * Strengthen version checking for LibIDN2 during the cmake step so
    LibIDN2 version 2.3.3 can be properly found (thanks jpbion).
  * Updated systemd/stubby.service file. Thanks Bruno Pagani
  * log level configurable in config file with log_level setting
    Command line setting (with -v or -l) overrules the config file
    setting
