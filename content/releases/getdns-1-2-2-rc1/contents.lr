title: First release candidate for getdns-1.2.2
---
announcement:

Dear all,

We have a first release candidate for the upcoming 1.2.2 bugfix release of getdns.

Recently [Stubby] has seen increased interest.
Already after the release of the [Windows installer](https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/Windows+installer+for+Stubby), but even more so after the introduction of [Quad9] and the description of how to use [DNS-over-TLS] with [Stubby] by [Alex Band](https://medium.com/@alexander_band/privacy-using-dns-over-tls-with-the-new-quad9-dns-service-1ff2d2b687c5) and [St√©phane Borzmeyer](https://labs.ripe.net/Members/stephane_bortzmeyer/quad9-a-public-dns-resolver-with-security).

The increased install base has generated excellent feedback and has also revealed some bugs.
This release has those bugs fixed, and also contains a few more configuration options to be able to adapt to more diverse situations.

The bugs fixed with this release are:
  * A segfault with the native DNSSEC validation code when DS and DNSKEY queries timed out,
  * A non [RFC compliant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7871#section-7.1.2) [`edns_client_subnet_private`] option that caused some upstream EDNS Client Subnet implementations (i.e. [Unbound](https://unbound.net/)'s) to return `FORMERR`, and
  * Doing the meta queries for [Zero configuration DNSSEC](/tags/zeroconf-dnssec/) with the resolvers from `/etc/resolv.conf`, which cause [Stubby] to query itself for this, effectively breaking the possibility to fetch the root trust-anchors and bootstrap DNSSEC.

Besides these fixes, this release allows to configure a [`getdns_context`] to be initialized with `resolv.conf` and `hosts` at alternative locations, with the [`getdns_context_set_resolvconf()`] and [`getdns_context_set_hosts()`] functions.
Also a specific location for the CA store, for authenticating [DNS-over-TLS] upstreams, can be specified with the [`getdns_context_set_CApath()`] and [`getdns_context_set_CAfile()`] functions.

The [`getdns_context_get_api_information()`] function exposes more [`getdns_context`] settings, amongst which:
  * The default settings for [extensions](/documentation/spec/#3-extensions),
  * The paths for files that were used to initialize a [`getdns_context`] (`resolv.conf`, `hosts` and trust anchors), and
  * More information about the version, configuration and capabilities of the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) library in use.

This release candidate includes a candidate for a 0.2.0 release of [Stubby].
The most prominent bugfix therein is to **not** do DNSSEC validation for queries with the `CD` bit set, when DNSSEC validation was not configured in the first place.
This bug caused decreased performance for configurations with an [unbound](https://unbound.net/) forwarding to [Stubby].

Please review this release candidate carefully, if all is well, the actual release will follow Thursday the 21th of December.
