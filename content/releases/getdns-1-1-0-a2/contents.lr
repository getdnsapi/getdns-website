announcement:

We have a special NANOG68 second alpha release of getdns 1.1.0 available for early testing of a subset of features planned for this release.

This release introduces **Stubby**, a version of `getdns_query` that listens on  the loopback interface and acts as a local stub resolver daemon.  Stubby reads configuration files from `/etc/stubby.conf` and `$HOME/.stubby.conf`.  Here is an example stubby configuration that configures Stubby to use the DNS-OARC TLS resolvers as its upstream:

```
{ dns_transport_list: [ GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS ]
, upstream_recursive_servers: [ 184.105.193.78, 2620:ff:c000:0:1::64:25 ]
}
````

For more information, see the NANOG68 presentation: <https://www.nanog.org/sites/default/files/3_stubby-nanog68.pdf>

Documentation is available at:

* getdns API documentation: <https://getdnsapi.net/documentation/spec/>
* getdns doxygen: <https://getdnsapi.net/doxygen/>
* getdns as a DNS-over-TLS local stub resolver:<https://portal.sinodun.com/wiki/display/TDNS/DNS+Privacy+daemon+-+Stubby>

**Beware** that this documentation is not on par with Stubby operation yet.
Expect an updated announcement on the website as soon as we have updated the documentation.
