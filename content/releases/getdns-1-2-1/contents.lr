changelog:

* 2017-11-11: Version 1.2.1
  * Stubby v0.1.5 included
  * Handle more I/O error cases.  Also, when an I/O error does occur,
    never stop listening (with servers), and
    never exit (when running the built-in event loop).
  * Bugfix: Tolerate unsigned and unused RRsets in the authority
    section.  Fixes DNSSEC with BIND upstream.
  * Bugfix: DNSSEC validation without support records
  * Bugfix: Validation of full recursive DNSKEY lookups
  * Bugfix: Retry to validate full recursion BOGUS replies with zero
    configuration DNSSEC only when DNSSEC was actually requested
  * Bugfix #348: Fix a linking issue in stubby when libbsd is present
    Thanks Remi Gacogne
  * More robust scheduling; Eliminating a segfault with long running
    applications.
  * Miscellaneous Windows portability fixes from Jim Hague.
  * Fix Makefile dependencies for parallel install.
    Thanks ilovezfs

  * Add Windows installer package. Installer available at dnsprivacy.org

  * Add SPKI for Uncensored DNS (thanks woopstar)
  * Fix installation of stubby.yml file (thanks ArchangeGabriel)
  * Fix detection of platform for standalone build
  * Fix location of pid file installation
  * Update the stubby.yml file to contain details of all available servers.
    Only a small subset are enabled by default.

* 2017-10-20: Version 0.1.4
  * '-i' option of stubby no longer tries to bind to the listen addresses so
    it can be run without requiring root privileges. Makes it easier to validate
    the configuration file syntax. 
  * Fix incorrect IP addresses for some servers in the config file. Add note that
    IPv6 addresses ending in :: are not supported (must use ::0). Also add 
    example of using a specific port in a listen address.
  * Fixes for Windows support
